            <p>I’m a digital nomad, travelling and coding as I go.  I love to see someone's creative vision and bring that to life in the world of web development!
                <br>
                My much-loved PC games are now gathering dust as I have replaced them with - arguably - the equally fun, frustrating, challenging and rewarding hobby and career of Web Development.  I will finish my games...some time!
